# Congressional-Apportionment

Congressional Apportionment is the process of dividing the 435 memberships, or seats, in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50 states. This project used census data to build a model to predict population by state for 2020. That population data was run through the apportionment algorithm to assign seats. We also conducted exploratory analysis, forecasted scenarios where The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico were added as states. The project also explored trends in domestic migration, and explored reasons for those trends.

The data sources for the census data are from the U.S Census Bureu(2018), 
The economic freedom index data is from The Cato Institute
